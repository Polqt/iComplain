## Authentication 

### Description
Role-based access control system with administrative privileges for facility management staff.

### Technical Implementation

**Admin Role:**

There is a single admin role with full system access. All administrators have the same permissions to:
- View and manage all tickets
- Update ticket status and priority
- Assign tickets to maintenance teams
- Generate reports and analytics
- Manage locations and categories

**Endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/auth/admin/login/           # Admin login
POST   /api/auth/admin/logout/          # Admin logout
GET    /api/auth/admin/profile/         # Get admin profile
PUT    /api/auth/admin/profile/         # Update profile
```

### Security Considerations

- Admin sessions timeout after 1 hour of inactivity
- All admin actions logged in audit trail
- Strong password requirements enforced
- HTTPS only in production
