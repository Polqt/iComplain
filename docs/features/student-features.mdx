## Authentication

### Description
Secure authentication system allowing students to access the facility management platform using their institutional credentials.

### Technical Implementation

**Endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/auth/register/          # Student registration
POST   /api/auth/login/             # Login with credentials
POST   /api/auth/logout/            # Invalidate JWT token
POST   /api/auth/refresh/           # Refresh access token
POST   /api/auth/password-reset/    # Request password reset
PUT    /api/auth/password-reset/confirm/  # Confirm new password
```

**Authentication Flow:**
```
1. Student submits credentials
2. Backend validates against database
3. JWT access + refresh tokens generated
4. Tokens stored securely (cookies or local storage)
5. Access token used for subsequent requests
6. Refresh token renews access token when expired
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Passwords hashed 
- JWT tokens with short expiration (1 hour for access, 7 days for refresh)
- Rate limiting on login attempts (max 5 per minute)
- HTTPS only in production
